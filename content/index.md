In short: i'm a software engineer, mainly JS frontend, but i don't shy away
from other languages or environments. I love to problem solve and learn new
things. Clean code and good architecture are always on my mind. Besides the
technical stuff i always try to be the best colleague i can be. Whether it's
helping others, or just having a chat. I'm always up for a good conversation.
I love to learn from others and share my knowledge. When i have a question or
think something could be done better, i'm not afraid to ask or speak up.
