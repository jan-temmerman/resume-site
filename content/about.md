# I like to work out

::cThreeFourths
When I'm not behind my laptop, you can probably find my at the gym, out on a run, in the swimming pool, or on the bike.
But don't get fooled, my endurance still sucks. When I'm not working out, I love to do the complete opposite and chill in
the couch watching a movie or series. You don't make my day by taking me out for a fancy expensive dinner, but by surprising
me with a McDonald's drive through or a kebab. While typing this I'm starting to understand why my endurance still sucks.

Personality wise, I'm a pretty shy and introverted person at first. I need some time to get to know the group before I start
to open up. But once I do, I can be pretty loud and talkative. I can be very silly at times, but when the conversation needs
me to be serious, I definitely can be. I'm a very loyal person and I will always be there for you when you need me.
